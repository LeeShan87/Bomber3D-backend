# Bomber3D-backend

I'm thinking about ways, how can I show my previous work. Well, the ones I have permission to do so. :D

And I found an old video about one of my side projects when I was at the university.

It was called Bomber3D.

The original YouTube video is available at:

Its music is annoying as hell, but at least loud.

This project will be mentioned In an upcoming blog post of mine.

## Deprecated Notice

This project originally used Unity ~4.5 around 2012. I could migrate it to a newer version, but hear it is not the point.

It used Unity web player as an build option. And it was available on Facebook as a Facebook app.

All mentioned technologies are deprecated.

## Security Notice

After I've reviewed my old code I found multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the code.
This means there could be also XSS or second-order XSS vulnerabilities as well.

This project is not used anywhere in production.
